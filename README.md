# Advent of Code 2019. Solutions in Clojure

Solutions to the problems in [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019). My timezone
sucks, so I'll be doing the solutions much later than when the problems are
released, but whatever.

The command:

``` text
lein run a b c
```

Will show solutions for the specified days (a b c ...). If no arguments are
given will show the solutions of every day so far implemented. Example:

``` text
$ lein run 1

  =========================================
 | Day | Star | Solution                   |
 |=========================================|
 |  1  |  *   | 3382136                    |
 |     |  **  | 5070314                    |
  =========================================
"Elapsed time: 18.774805 msecs"

```

If you want to try your inputs, input files are stored at `resources/dayXX.txt`
